### Zephyr Messaging ðŸŒ¬ 

A messaging platform looking to the future of UX and cybersecurity. 


#### âœ¨ Features
 - **Nested reactions** - React to anything! Zephyr lets you react to other's reactions for when you just need to comment on that ðŸ’€ 
 - **Stacks** - Messaging just got elevated to a new dimension: taking a new approach to thread visual design, stacks will pile messages and reactions in 3d space, allowing quick access down the rabbit hole. 
 - 

#### ðŸ”’ Security
 - **Quantum-secure encryption** - Zephyr uses the CRYSTALS-cyber and CRYSTALS-dilithum quantum-resistant encryption and certificate algorithms selected by NIST in 2022 for preliminary post-quantum cryptography. In the event this algorithm proves secure, your data will be safe hundreds of years into the future even against state-of-the-art quantum computers.
 - **True and false E2E** - Zephyr lets you choose what to do with your security: You may keep your data completely inaccessible to any server breaches with only a single irreplaceable client per account, or trade that off to allow multiple device logins by storing a version that can be accessed if the attackers know your password.
